A simple CSS Gradient Animator tool powered by VueJS, VueX and SASS. Idea behind building this tool is to quickly generate the CSS Gradient Animations which will help the developer have a quick preview of the selected color palettes instantly. Also, the animation code can be quickly copied by pressing the <kbd>c</kbd> key.
